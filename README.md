# ideas
This is a simple forum, that was made for practice. First you should add your own connection string:
```php
$link = pg_connect("CONNECT");
```
You have to do this twice (in index.php and one more time in search.php). Then, you can use a link in the description to see everything. You can add your own idea (or something else) and find it.
